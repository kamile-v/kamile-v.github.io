            <p>One problem that I found challenging to solve in System's Design was determining the feasibility for my proposed application PlannerBird.<br>
            As someone that has not worked on developing software before, I had a difficult time coming up with an assessment for the technical, resource, <br>
                schedule, organizational, and legal feasibility of the project.<br>
            Luckily, with careful attention to detail and a lot of learning, I was able to come up with an assessment. Whether it would be accurate in the <br>
                real world or not, I now have experience considering various possibilities that could affect the outcome of a software development project.<br>
                I hope to get more experience doing this in the future. If interested, the System Specification for Plannerbird is attached in the Projects <br>
                section on this website.</p>
